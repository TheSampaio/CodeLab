# Code Lab

This repository contains my personal projects, organized to showcase my skills in frontend and backend development.

## Repository Structure

- `frontend/`  
  Contains applications and user interfaces primarily built with React and other frontend technologies.

- `backend/`  
  Contains APIs and services developed using Node.js, ASP.NET, and other backend technologies.

## Example Projects

- **React Login Site (`react-login-site`)**  
  A React SPA login project focused on the user interface and authentication flow.  
  _(Frontend only â€“ no backend connection)_

To run a project, navigate to its folder and follow the instructions in its README.
